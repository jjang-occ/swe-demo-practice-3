Here is a list
* item a
* item b
* item c

An ordered list
1. first
2. second
3. third

## heading 2.2

How about some code
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
   cout << "hello" << endl;
   cout << "I added this line locally " << endl;
   cout << "I added this line locally again" << endl;
   cout << "I added this line remotely" << endl;
   cout << "And other people made changes too" << endl;
   return 0;
}
```
